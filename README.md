A crop recommendation app based on supervised machine learning models
This app was developed as a final graduation project for the Data Science Bootcamp.
All the base code, and ML models used for the development of this app are available in this repository. The app is not made public due to copyright of some of the crop images used and will be made publicly available with original images soon.  
A recorded video of the working app can be viewed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PL8FqYs5TiC-Ep5bz8AqdPJ9IEXey2YY/view?usp=drive_link
